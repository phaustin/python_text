# How to run the notebooks

If a page has a rocketship icon in the upper right hand corner, you can launch a jupyter notebook
in another tab by rolling over the rocketship and right-clicking.  The first time you do this,
you will need to log into the jupyterhub.  When you do this subsequently, jupyterhub will
open on the page.
